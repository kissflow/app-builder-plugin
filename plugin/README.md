# Kissflow App Builder

A Claude Code plugin that turns an idea or a requirements document into a running Kissflow app:
data models, roles, workflows, permissions and pages in your Kissflow account, with an optional
custom React UI. This folder carries the commands, the specialist agents, the reference documents
they read, and a small launcher for the build engine.

## Setup

Once per project folder:

```
/author-setup
```

The first run downloads the build engine for your platform (about 100 MB, once per version) and
connects the folder to your Kissflow account. By default you paste an access key you create in
Kissflow (profile picture › My settings › API authentication › Access keys) into a page that opens in
your browser; you can also sign in with Kissflow instead. Either way the app is built as you, with your
Kissflow permissions, and the credential stays in your home folder.

## Use

```
/build-app "<a one-line idea, or the path to a BRD>"
```

Or step by step: `/author-brief` → `/author-plan` → `/author-review` → `/author-refine` →
`/author-preview` → `/author-generate`. `/author-status` and `/author-runs` show where a build stands.

Everything targets your development environment. Nothing publishes to production.
