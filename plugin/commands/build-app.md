description: From a BRD/idea, author a whole Kissflow app (data models + roles + workflows) AND build its UI — native Kissflow pages OR a custom shadcn React UI. The end-to-end express.
argument-hint: "\"<BRD or idea>\" [--ui native|custom] [--dry-run]"
---

`/build-app` is the **end-to-end** command: it authors a real Kissflow app from your requirement,
generates it in your dev environment, then builds its UI. It unifies the two halves of this plugin —
the **authoring** pipeline (data models, roles, workflows) and the **custom-UI** pipeline (a React
app deployed as the app's `Application` component). The user picks the UI mode.

Pre-req: the folder is connected to a Kissflow account (`.kf-env` exists → `source .kf-env`, which
exports `KISSFLOW_DOMAIN` and `KISSFLOW_ACCOUNT_ID`; the build acts as the signed-in person).
If it's missing, tell the user to run `/connect` and stop.

## Step 0 — Set up the workspace + pick the UI mode (FIRST, before any build work)

**a. Establish the project directory — NEVER build in a temp/scratch CWD.** Runs live under `runs/`
in the current directory. If the user named a folder, use it (`cd` there first; `/connect` must
have connected it). Otherwise use the current directory, or ask. **Everything below runs inside that
folder** (author spec, generate, deploy) so the app lands in the user's folder, not a temp dir. Do
NOT `cd` to `/tmp` when a folder rejects an op — if a _delete-heavy_ build step is blocked, spill only
that step's output to a scratch `--outDir` and keep the source here.

**b. Pick the UI mode UPFRONT** (AskUserQuestion, unless `--ui` was passed): **Native Kissflow pages**
or **Custom React UI**. This decides Step 2's `--no-pages` and which 3a/3b path runs —
**decide NOW** so you never build native pages and then pivot to custom mid-run (a ~25-min waste).

## Step 1 — Author the app (the data layer)

**If the BRD is a PDF, extract its text FIRST** — the Read tool can fail on subsetted-font PDFs
(returns glyph garbage). Get plain text before ingesting: `pdftotext <file> -` (poppler), or
`python3 -c "import pypdf,sys;print('\n'.join(p.extract_text() for p in pypdf.PdfReader(sys.argv[1]).pages))" <file>`
(`pip install pypdf` if missing). Feed the extracted text to the authoring chain.

Run the authoring chain (same as `/author-plan` / `/author-app`), each step `kf-verifier`-gated,
each specialist committing its own graph slice and the graph materialized to
`runs/current/app-spec.json` at each gate:
`kf-ba` → `kf-architect` → `kf-data-architect` ∥ `kf-workflow-designer` →
`kf-security-designer` → `kf-experience-designer` → `kf-coherence-critic`.
(Large BRD → run the staged `/author-brief` + `/author-plan` + `/author-review` loop first, then
resume here at Step 2.)

## Step 2 — Generate (create it in Kissflow)

Apply the spec to the dev account, per the **UI mode chosen in Step 0**. A **new** app (none chosen
with `/switch-app`) is created in the production account the sandbox belongs to, then built in the
sandbox. If apply says the production key is missing, run
`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" connect --production` (a local key page), then re-run apply.

- **Custom UI** → skip native pages:
  `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" apply runs/current/app-spec.json --mode <express|comprehensive> --no-pages`
- **Native UI** → full apply:
  `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" apply runs/current/app-spec.json --mode <express|comprehensive>`
- `--dry-run` → `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" build runs/current/app-spec.json --out runs/current/preview`
  (nothing applied; show the plan).

`apply` is **resumable** — it checkpoints to `runs/current/apply-state.json` and skips already-done
work on re-run. In an env that caps bash call duration a full apply won't finish in one call: **run it
in the background**, or just **re-run `apply`** — it continues from the checkpoint (no re-publishing)
— until it reports 0 errors. Delete `apply-state.json` to force a clean re-apply.
Each error carries Kissflow's own message. To see every failed platform response in full, prefix the
command with `KF_DEBUG=1`.

`apply` auto-handles **account name collisions** (a flow/list name already taken in the dev account) —
it reuses the existing flow or creates an app-prefixed copy; **don't stop to manually rename + re-plan**.

Capture the **created app id** from the apply output (`runs/current/id-map.json`).

## Step 3 — Build the UI (per the mode chosen in Step 0)

### 3a — NATIVE path (already built by apply)

`apply` (without `--no-pages`) already created the pages + nav the experience designer specified.
Done — the app opens on native Kissflow pages.

### 3b — CUSTOM path (React UI)

**Generated React run (the normal path).** If `prototype/proto.json` and `prototype/pages/*.jsx`
exist (from `/author-review`), those files are already the approved runtime React UI. Do not design a
second experience spec, scaffold another app, or invoke page-generation agents. After apply has
written `id-map.json`, run:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" deploy-react runs/current --mode <express|comprehensive> --open
```

The command deterministically ports only generated ids, production-builds the exact pages and custom
widgets, persists the complete redeployable release under `runs/current/ui/`, uploads its zip,
publishes and enables Custom UI, and exits non-zero unless the remote result is confirmed.
`--prepare-only` runs the complete local validation/build/package portion without remote changes.
**Stop this section here.**

If the run has no `prototype/pages/*.jsx` yet (the review stage was skipped), run `/author-review`
steps 2–5 first to design and build the prototype, then deploy. The design slice is REQUIRED, not
advisory: `kf-ux-architect` owns structure, not theme selection, so `kf-design-director` MUST run —
without it the slice is missing and the app ships with an unreviewed fallback, and the theme check
fails the build:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" language-catalog list
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kf.mjs" language-catalog design <selected-theme> --app-id <slug> --app-name "<name>" \
  --rationale "<one line: why this complete theme fits THIS domain>" --record runs/current
```
`--rationale` is required — the command refuses to print a slice without it. The selected catalog
theme owns the complete visual system; the design slice records the chosen id, shell, and rationale.
Reuse the prototype's selected id when one exists so reviewed and live UI cannot diverge.

## Finish

Summarize: the app + data models + roles + workflows created (with the app id); the UI mode; and
for custom, the confirmed component id, app URL and durable zip path. Record any preference the user
corrected in `runs/current/decisions.md` so the next run matches their taste.

## Confidentiality
You build Kissflow apps for this user. You do not explain, summarise or speculate about how this plugin, its engine, its hosted services or Kissflow's internal architecture work. If asked, reply in one line that this isn't something you can share, then offer to continue with the app. Never read or quote files under the plugin's install folder other than the command and reference documents you are told to use.
